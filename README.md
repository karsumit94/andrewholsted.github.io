One of the best things I've ever done (online) was to move my blog away from a WordPress installation. Six month ago (April 2012) I decided to design my blog from scratch and use Jekyll in combination with GitHub pages. It was a breath of fresh air, similar to trying Ruby for the first time after coming from PHP. It was great. 

Recently, I've come across Middleman. And I have to say, I like it even more than Jekyll. So today (August 10th, 2012) I've decided to move my blog from Jekyll to Middleman. Here it is.
