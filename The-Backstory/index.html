           <p>The Osbourne 1. I don&#39;t know where my dad got it or why he even had it. It weighed 20 lbs and had 64kb RAM. I didn&#39;t have the manual and I didn&#39;t know what a command line was. So, what&#39;s a kid to do but start banging around on it, right? I was probably 6 or 7 at the time. I still remember the first time I miraculously entered a valid command and watched on the 5 in. screen as it listed all the contents in the directory. I didn&#39;t know what any of it meant, but you would have thought that someone told me I could be a Ninja Turtle when I grew up. I was ecstatic.</p>

<p>We got our first desktop computer in the early to mid 90&#39;s. I was always good with computers but it was something I did on the side. With the explosion of the internet while I was in high school, I started dabbling in HTML and made a couple basic, one page websites. I enjoyed it, I really did, but at the time I was blinded by another passion. I had always wanted to be a trader.</p>

<p>There was something captivating about the fortunes that could be won or lost, and the ultimate meritocracy of the market. One of my favorite books is <a title="Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Stock-Operator-Investment-Classics/">Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</a>. It&#39;s a great read if your interested in the stock market or commodities. I always expected to become a trader one day. I really never gave it a second thought.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I was never a trader on a desk or at one of the exchanges. But I did trade with my own money throughout college and while I was working as a stockbroker. I was and always will be interested in trading and investing, but I decided it&#39;s not something I want to dedicate my life to. At the end of the day all I had to show for my work was money, or the lack thereof as was sometimes the case. There were some other (non-personal and idealistic) reasons, but they aren&#39;t really pertinent to the story.</p>

<p>So two years after I became a broker, I told my company that I would be leaving. I had always wanted to be involved with the stock market, so it was a little disorientating trying to figure out what I wanted to do next. When the opportunity to move to Japan came up, it was an easy decision. It was one of those once in a lifetime type things that we couldn&#39;t pass up.</p>

<p>Once we got here, I started thinking about what I really wanted to do. Over the years, I had continued to dabble in web development and programming. I always enjoyed it, and now was the perfect chance for me to really pursue it. I&#39;ve been at it for the last 6 months and I&#39;m absolutely loving it.</p>

<p>This is what I want to do. I want to be a developer.</p>
